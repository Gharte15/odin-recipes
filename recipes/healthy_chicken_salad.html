    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This healthy chicken salad recipe is made with a mixture of Greek yogurt and cottage cheese instead of regular mayonnaise, resulting in a healthier version that's still creamy and delicious but higher in protein. Apples and dried cranberries add a sweet-tart flavor, while chopped pecans provide textural interest in every bite. Serve it on crackers, on a croissant, in a pita, or grab a fork and just dig </p>
